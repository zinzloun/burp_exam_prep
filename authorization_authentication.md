### OAuth account hijacking via redirect_uri
<b>Workflow</b><br/>
Login to the portal using OAuth -> OAuth server authentication (yes) -> Portal (authenticated)  with auth code in the QS

In the repeater since we are already authenticated, we can see the cookie session already set

We can modify the redirect_uri parameter without get any error. The parameter is used to generate the redirect

Now redirect the request to our payload hosted into the exploit server

After delivered to the victim the payload, we can inspect the exploit access log to get the leaked auth code:

Now we can use the code to access the portal bypassing the authentication process:
