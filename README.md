# Burp Exam Roadtrip
Here I collected the lab's solutions following the exam preparation steps required to get the certification (https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/how-to-prepare#step-1-complete-one-lab-from-every-topic). At the moment is a work in progress activity, I'm interested in the learning path, not in the certification.<br>
Please note that this is not a step-by-step guide to solve the labs, nor a guide about how to use Burp Suite, the aim of this work is to keep notes about the difficult tasks that I have faced solving the labs and sharing the information, of course try to solve the lab by yourself before accessing this material.<br>
In order to be able to follow the solutions I'm assuming that ou have some knowledge about:
+ how web apllications work
+ Burp Suite CE
+ common web app vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, XXE...)
+ how to approach a problem ðŸ˜ƒ

I really encourage to learn the related topic before to access a solution, otherwise it will be very difficult to understand the steps involved. To solve the labs I have used Burp CE only<br>
If you have any questions, suggestions or just to say hallo you can drop me an email: filobers[at]pm[dot]me.

Enjoy your learning trip!
